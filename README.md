Here we have the challenge about the two exercise of manual testing and automation. for more detail about the requirements of this excercise you can see [here](https://github.com/PriamoRodriguez/QAChallenge/blob/main/qa-challenge-reviewed_5e6f90ff6a001%20(1).pdf)

## Exercise (Manual QA) 1
This exercise is based on manual testing verifying the main navigaton looking for bugs, doing the test cases and executing in a manual way.

It has the next delivers:

1. A Google [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQpK_VsB3r3cn1j-S3pCdUx0N9XYsfBixoYePWOdBWhsV_dJiQ64MtHAqXc4EPoHtTctSyprlRe8skK/pubhtml) with the Smoke test and the Feedback's test cases.

2. A Trello [board](https://trello.com/b/ljOsVnZp/testboard) where we have the bugs listed and the bug cycle.

## Exercise (Automation) #2

* This automation test was developed on .Net using NUnit and Selenium as a test framework. 
* Is using Visual Studio 2019.
* The Desigh Pattern that is used in the test automation is __Page Object__.
* There’s a local path to my computer for the Webdriver but can be change. I added to the file too. 
* As I made before in the exercise 1, I use a [Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQpK_VsB3r3cn1j-S3pCdUx0N9XYsfBixoYePWOdBWhsV_dJiQ64MtHAqXc4EPoHtTctSyprlRe8skK/pubhtml) for the test cases.
* At least the [Trello’s](https://trello.com/b/QD0SdRdE/automation) tool for list the bugs.
